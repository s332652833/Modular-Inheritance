Ask for shape 

if ans = circle
  what is the radius?
  circ.area = (pi*r^2)
  circ.perimeter = (2*pi*r)

else if ans = semicircle
  what is the radius?
  semi.area = (pi*r^2)/2
  semi.perimeter = (2*pi*r)/2 + 2r
  
else if ans = triangle
  what is the side lengths and height?
  triangle.area = (base*height)/2
  triangle.perimeter = (side a + side b + side c)
  
else if ans = rectangle
  what is the length and width?
  rect.area = (length*width)
  rect.perimeter = (2length + 2Width)

else if ans = square
  what is the side length?
  square.area = (length^2)
  square.perimeter = (4length)
  
else if ans = parallelogram
  what is the base, height and side length?
  gram.area = (base*height)
  gram.perimeter = (2base+2length)

else if ans = pentagon
  what is the side length?
  pent.area = o.25* sqroot(5*(5+2*root5))* length^2
  pent.perimeter = (5length)
  
else if ans = hexagon
  what is the side length?
  hex.area = (3*root3)/2 * length^2
  hex.perimeter = (6length)
